Welcome to NatureOS official repository!

## What is it?

Perhaps you will laugh or think that this is stupid - BUT! This is my first fairly large project - NatureOS Pseudo Operating System. I’ll make a reservation right away - I don’t understand anything in the development of operating systems and with the help of C / C ++ and their capabilities I roughly implement the capabilities of conventional operating systems.

## Support

At the moment, there is only support for the Windows G++ compiler.

## How i can use it?

Everything is super easy! To get started, you go to this site: http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?fa=fortran Where you download the compiler (It says gcc, but it comes with g++). Then clone this repository and use the `g++ -Wall Core.cpp -o Nature.exe` command to compile the project (this may take time)

## How i can get more info?

In `docs` folder!
